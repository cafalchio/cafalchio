## Hello there! 👋
“Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” — Cory House


Matheus here, a passionate **Python Developer**, currently diving into the world of **Rust** 🦀.

## How I got here:

**PhD in Neuroscience**: Spent my time decoding the brain waves and learning how to program meanwhile.

**Python**: From data analysis to building full-stack apps, Python is my trusty companion. 🐍

**Rust**: Currently learning this powerful language. Still getting used to its sintaxe… but I’ll get there! 😉

**React/Typescript**: I use react when I need to build responsive websites and for experimenting with ![Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) 

**Tauri**: if you never heard about it, please check it out, it's magical! ✨
