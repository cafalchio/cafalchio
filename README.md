**Python**: From data analysis to building full-stack apps, Python is my trusty companion. 

**Rust**: Currently learning this powerful language. Still getting used to its sintaxe… but I’ll get there! 

**React/Typescript**: I use react when I need to build responsive websites and for experimenting with ![Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/)
