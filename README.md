# Hello there! 👋

“Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” — Cory House

I'm **Matheus**, a passionate **Python Developer** 🐍, currently diving into the world of **Rust** 🦀.
## My Journey:

🔬 **PhD in Neuroscience**: Spent my time decoding the brain, but realized coding is my true passion.

💻 **Python**: From data analysis to building full-stack apps, Python is my trusty companion. 🐍

🦀 **Rust**: Currently learning this powerful language. Still getting used to its sintaxe… but I’ll get there! 😉

⚛️ **React**: Building interactive UIs and learning more about front-end development.

🛠️ **Tauri**: Experimenting with Tauri, if you never heard about it, please check, it is powerfull - ![Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/)

## Fun facts:

- I once translated MATLAB code into Python during my PhD just to stop to use Matlab.
