# Hello there! 👋

“Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” — Cory House

I'm **Matheus**, a passionate **Python Developer** 🐍, currently diving into the world of **Rust** 🦀. When I'm not coding, you might find me thinking about brain waves 🧠—I have a PhD in **Neuroscience**!

## My Journey:

🔬 **PhD in Neuroscience**: Spent my time decoding the brain, but realized coding is my true passion.

💻 **Python**: From data analysis to building full-stack apps, Python is my trusty companion. 🐍

🦀 **Rust**: Currently learning this powerful language. Still getting used to its sintaxe… but I’ll get there! 😉

## Fun facts:

- I once translated MATLAB code into Python during my PhD just to stop to use Matlab.
